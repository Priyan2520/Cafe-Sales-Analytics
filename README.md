## 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers a complete analytics solution for a multi-location cafe operation — from raw, dirty transactional data through a structured cleaning and engineering pipeline, to an interactive Power BI executive dashboard with 3 analytical views.

The work mirrors a real consulting engagement: messy source data, business-defined KPIs, stakeholder-facing reporting, and strategic recommendations grounded in the numbers.

**Scope:** 10,000 transactions · 3 locations · 10 product lines · 4 payment methods · Full Year 2023

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Management needs visibility into **which products, locations, and channels are actually driving profitability** — not just revenue. The raw transaction data is unreliable: 39% of location fields are missing, 32% of payment methods are null, invalid tokens are scattered across all columns, and Total Spent values don't consistently reconcile with Quantity × Price.

Without a clean, trusted dataset, the business cannot:
- Identify high-margin vs drag products
- Compare channel profitability (In-Store vs Takeaway vs Delivery)
- Detect seasonal revenue trends
- Make data-driven pricing or inventory decisions

## 🔧 Data Cleaning Process

The raw dataset contained compounding quality issues across all 8 columns.

| Issue | Count | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Invalid tokens (`ERROR`, `UNKNOWN`, `N/A`) | Across all columns | Replaced with `NaN` before processing |
| Missing Location values | 3,961 rows (39.6%) | Mode imputation per item group |
| Missing Payment Method | 3,178 rows (31.8%) | Mode imputation with fallback |
| Unparseable Transaction Dates | 460 rows | Dropped — unrecoverable |
| Total Spent ≠ Qty × Price | 437 rows | Autocorrected via formula |
| Duplicate rows | 0 | No action needed |

**Pipeline:** 9 automated transformation steps → 6 validation assertions → all passing. Output: 9,540 clean rows with zero nulls and schema-enforced column types.

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Derived columns added on top of the cleaned dataset:

| Column | Logic | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Revenue` | `Quantity × Price_Per_Unit` | Normalised revenue basis |
| `Cost` | `Revenue × 0.60` | COGS at 60% assumption |
| `Profit` | `Revenue - Cost` | Gross profit per transaction |
| `Profit_Margin_Pct` | `Profit / Revenue` | Margin rate |
| `DayOfWeek` | From `Transaction_Date` | Weekday pattern analysis |
| `Week` | ISO week number | Weekly trending |
| `Month` / `Month_Num` | Month name + sort key | Chronological sorting |
| `Quarter` / `Quarter_Label` | Period grouping | Quarterly rollup |
| `Month_Start` | First day of month | Time intelligence base |

---

## 🗃️ SQL Analytics

15 production queries across 5 analytical domains:

| Domain | Queries | Techniques Used |
|---|---|---|
| Executive KPIs | Q1–Q2 | Aggregation, computed margins |
| Revenue Trends | Q3–Q5 | CTEs, `LAG()`, `DATE_TRUNC()` |
| Product Performance | Q6–Q8 | `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, window aggregates |
| Location & Channel | Q9–Q11 | `PIVOT`-style `CASE`, contribution % |
| Payment Behaviour | Q12–Q15 | Cross-tab analysis, `NTILE()` |

All queries use CTEs for readability, work across PostgreSQL / MySQL 8+ / SQLite, and include inline business commentary.

Profit Margin % =

-- MoM Revenue Growth %
MoM Growth % =

-- Revenue Contribution % (context-aware)
Revenue Contribution % =
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue],
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], ALL('Sales'[Item])),
    0

-- Dynamic Top N Products
Top N Revenue =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    TOPN([Top N Value], ALL('Sales'[Item]), [Total Revenue])

## 📈 Key Business Insights

> These are data-derived findings, not generic observations.

**Revenue & Growth**
- Full-year revenue of ₹88.95K grew **12.6% vs prior year** with profit growing faster at **15.3%** — indicating improving operational efficiency, not just volume growth.
- Revenue is flat month-to-month (₹6.9K–₹10K range) with no strong seasonality signal. The absence of seasonal peaks is itself a finding — it suggests the cafe lacks promotional strategy tied to seasons or events.

**Product Mix**
- Coffee leads at ₹23.7K (26.7% share) with a 38.4% profit margin — the highest-margin, highest-volume product. This is the core business anchor.
- Brownie and Scone (₹1.8K and ₹1.2K combined) contribute under 3% of revenue with the two lowest margins (27.4% and 26.3%). These are candidates for menu restructuring — either a price increase or discontinuation.
- Cake outperforms its revenue rank: at 37.8% margin, it earns nearly as much per unit as Coffee despite lower volume.

**Channel & Location**
- Takeaway dominates at 47.8% of revenue. Delivery, at 19.3%, is the smallest channel but likely has the highest operational cost — net profitability by channel is the critical missing metric management needs.
- In-Store contributes 32.9% of revenue. If in-store labour and occupancy costs are factored, this channel may be the weakest net contributor.

**Payment Behaviour**
- Cash still accounts for 36.6K (41.1%) of revenue. A shift toward Digital Wallet reduces handling costs; an active incentive program (e.g., 5% discount on Digital Wallet orders above ₹50) could accelerate adoption.

## 🧭 Strategic Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| High | Price Brownie +15%, Scone +20%; test elasticity over 60 days | Margin recovery on low-revenue SKUs |
| High | Introduce a Delivery minimum order value (e.g., ₹80) | Improves delivery channel unit economics |
| Medium | Bundle Coffee + Cake as a combo SKU at ₹95 (vs ₹98 separate) | Increases Cake attach rate, maintains margin |
| Medium | Run a Digital Wallet cashback promotion for In-Store orders | Reduces cash handling cost, boosts in-store visits |
| Low | Add a loyalty program trigger for customers with 5+ transactions | Basket size and frequency uplift |
